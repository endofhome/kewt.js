### A cute and pointless JavaScript testing framework.

I wrote this on a train as I don't have any JavaScript testing frameworks globally installed, didn't have access to the internet (i.e. NPM), and wanted to unit test some code. There's probably no other practical use for this, but I was pleasantly surprised as to how quick to write and useful it was for me at the time.
